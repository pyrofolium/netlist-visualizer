This folder contains React components for SVG rendering.

Most components take netlist-render data structures and draw everything as an SVG.

The folder also includes:

- `SvgLoading.tsx`: A customizable SVG loading animation component that can be used to indicate loading states. It
  doesn't require netlist-render data structures.
